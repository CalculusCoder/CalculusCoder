### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Jared!

I'm a software developer based in **Charlotte, NC**, currently studying Computer and Information Technology at **FIU**. I love working with systems programming, database development, and backend infrastructure. But most of my time is spent working with web, mobile, and database development.

**Some projects I've been working on**

### [Jared Systems](https://your-link-here.com)  
A **Direct Store Delivery (DSD) and accounting B2B solution** for companies. While working as a business partner at **La Hacienda**, we relied on similar software, but it was bloated and expensive. So, I built my own solution and am now selling it as a **faster, more efficient alternative**.

### [Galaxity Learning](https://your-link-here.com)  
An **automated AI-powered math tutoring app** integrated into school **LMS systems**. As a former **math tutor**, I wanted to create a **gamified learning app** that seamlessly integrates with teacher tools like **Schoology** and **Google Classroom**. **Currently 90% complete**.

### [Cryptography Library](https://your-link-here.com)  
A **cryptography library** supporting **two ciphers and one key exchange algorithm (Diffie-Hellman)**. The core logic is built in **C**, with a **Node.js bridge via Child Process** and a frontend for encrypting text.

### [FreeMind Recovery](https://your-link-here.com)  
A **full-stack mental health application** designed to help people struggling with mental health issues. **Over 1,000 users**. This was the first full-stack app I built while learning web development.
