### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Jared!

I'm a software developer based in Charlotte, NC, currently studying Computer and Information Technology at FIU. I love working with systems programming and database development. But most of my time is spent working with web, mobile, and database development.


**Some projects I've been working on:**

* **[Jared Systems](https://your-link-here.com)**: A Direct Store Delivery (DSD) and accounting B2B solution for companies. While working as a business partner at La Hacienda, we relied on similar software, but it was bloated and expensive. So, I built my own solution.

* **[Galaxity Learning](https://your-link-here.com)**: An automated AI math tutoring app integrated into school LMS systems. While tutoring math to children during college, I wanted to create a gamified learning app for them that integrates with teacher tools like Schoology and Google Classroom. Currently 90% complete and on pause as i'm mostly working on Jared Systems.

* **[Cryptography Library](https://your-link-here.com)**: A cryptography library supporting two ciphers and one key exchange algorithm (Diffie-Hellman)**. The core logic is built in **C**, with a **Node.js bridge via Child Process** and a frontend for encrypting text.

### [FreeMind Recovery](https://your-link-here.com)  
A **full-stack mental health application** designed to help people struggling with mental health issues. **Over 1,000 users**. This was the first full-stack app I built while learning web development.
